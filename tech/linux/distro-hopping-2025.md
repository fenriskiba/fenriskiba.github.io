# Distro Hopping
Planning to build a new PC, and want to try again after having issues in 2024. The goal will be to spend a month with each distro before moving on to the next. I may add or remove distros based on early impressions or issues I encounter with installation.

I'm avoiding Ubuntu and it's official flavours because of concerns about the Snap ecosystem being fully dependent on Canonical for hosting, but may reconsider after doing further research (most of the info I found is a few years old, but I don't care enough to look deeper at the moment).

**Distros to try:**
* [Linux Mint](distro-hopping-2024.md) (baseline)
* [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/)
* [Fedora KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde)
* [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) (TBD on which desktop version)
* [PikaOS](https://wiki.pika-os.com/en/home)
* [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) (planning to hold off for awhile to give Cosmic Desktop time to release and work out any issues)
* [Tuxedo OS](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-OS_1.tuxedo)
* [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed)
* [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
* [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/)
* [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)
* [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/)

I may also try some other Fedora spins, just as an excuse to see other desktop environments. At the moment, I think that, if I do try them, it'll start in a VM however and only get added to the full list if the desktop interests me. I may also look into other distros with that desktop if I find it interesting, but we will see.

## What I'll Be Trying
While I'm trying each distro, I'll be loosely trying the following things to see how well they meet my needs.

* Gaming
  * Not really a competitive gamer, so I'm not too worried about anti-cheat issues, but I do play some games.
  * Currently starting to try the Dark Souls games, so that'll give me a chance to use Proton.
    * Not expecting any issues at this point, given how good Proton is, but always a good sanity check.
  * Probably also going to try some Gamecube/Wii emulation, since I've found that's pretty easy on Mint.
  * VR with the Meta Quest 3
    * I'll try ALVR if I have to, but I'm hoping I can just use SteamLink VR.
* 3D Printing with PrusaSlicer
* [Mirroring Multiple Displays](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=418626)
* Light Development tasks
  * Containers with Podman
  * Go and Node development
