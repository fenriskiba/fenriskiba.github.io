# Tuxedo OS
!> **Important:** The exact content and phrasing of the Linux Distro Hopping docs are still pending. After I have finished using each distro and creating an initial write up, I will be doing a final pass of the whole series of pages and make any final adjustments.

* Initial Setup: Boot USB crashed after checking windowing server
  * Worked fine after a restart
* Had to Disable Secure Boot
  * https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/What-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-Secure-Boot.tuxedo
* Discover not showing all .deb options?
  * Steam .deb was missing, which for now is fine, but was weird since that's the official package still and Tuxedo isn't Flatpak only
* Dev setup was the same as Mint
* A lot of pre-installed apps I don't need
  * Mostly not a problem, but there were a few that were weird like Nextcloud Desktop
* Minor Annoyance: Doesn't consistently focus login password textbox
