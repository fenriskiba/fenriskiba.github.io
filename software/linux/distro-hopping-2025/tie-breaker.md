# Tie-Breaker Round
!> **Important:** The exact content and phrasing of the Linux Distro Hopping docs are still pending. After I have finished using each distro and creating an initial write up, I will be doing a final pass of the whole series of pages and make any final adjustments.

Now that I've gone through most of my planned distros (after some late disqualifications), I've narrowed it down to two distributions: Linux Mint and Fedora Workstation.  
At the moment, I am leaning towards Linux Mint, as they have recently resolved one of my biggest issues with the distro (lack of hardware support due to being on the LTS kernel), but I do want to give Fedora another chance to show what being more modern with Wayland support and the stable kernel can do. This will also give me a chance to test out a few things that I didn't have as much time as I'd like during my month with the distribution.

During the tie-breaker round, I'll start with Fedora and try getting a few things working to see if I encounter any issues:
* Low-latency remote desktop from my laptop.
  * This will help me test out some future setups for other things like couch gaming from a Steam Deck. I've been having issues with my original living room couch gaming setup, so I am looking for options.
  * I will try my best to make sure that this test is done with my laptop connected via an ethernet cable for this test to help rule out wifi stability/latency as a factor.
* VR gaming with the Meta Quest 3.
  * I wasn't able to get this working before, but I didn't try any solutions like [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR) or [WiVRn](https://github.com/WiVRn/WiVRn) because I just didn't have the time. This tie-breaker will not be concluded until I have had time to try both.
  * If I can't get it working with either, I may try buying a different VR headset as I do think that the Meta Quest 3 is part of the problem, but that is a last resort.
* Streaming with OBS (both PC games and console games).
  * I don't really have a lot of interest in steaming myself, but I am interested in the technology and would like to try learning it, and this seems like a good opportunity.
  * I may not actually test this on a real streaming platform, but just on a Discord server.
* Running Android apps on [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/).
  * This is not going to be a deal-breaker for the tie breaker as I don't have a use case for it and the biggest blocker is Wayland support, which the Mint team is working on, but I do want to try it out.

After spending that time with Fedora and attempting to get those to work, I'll move over to Mint and try everything I was able to get working there. If I can get everything that works in Fedora working on Mint, then I have feature parity on most of the tools I care about Mint will win this tie-breaker. If I can't get any of it working on Fedora, that will also count as an automatic win for Linux Mint.

If Mint wins the first tie-breaker, there will be a second tie-breaker round on my laptop. I use a [Framework laptop](https://frame.work/) and want to upgrade it the the latest mainboard. Once I've performed the upgrade, if Mint won the previous tie-breaker, then I will start with Linux Mint on the new hardware. If Mint works and I don't run into any issues, then it will be a complete win for Mint and I won't move onto Fedora, since Fedora has official support from the Framework team on most of their laptops.  
If I run into any kinds of issues with Mint not supporting the new hardware, then I'll move over to Fedora where I am much more confident that everything will work.
