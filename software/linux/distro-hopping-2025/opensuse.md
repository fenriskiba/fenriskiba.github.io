# openSUSE Tumbleweed
!> **Important:** The exact content and phrasing of the Linux Distro Hopping docs are still pending. After I have finished using each distro and creating an initial write up, I will be doing a final pass of the whole series of pages and make any final adjustments.

  * If I find a compelling reason to stick with openSUSE, I may try some of the other DEs and document that as a separate effort.
