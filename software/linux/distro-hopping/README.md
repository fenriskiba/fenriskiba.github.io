# Linux Distro Hopping 2026
In early 2025, I build a new desktop PC and decided to see what other Linux distros are like after using the same one for over a decade. To do so, I decided to hop around a few distributions and stick on them for about a month each to see how they performed for extended use. I figured a month would be enough time to really get a good feel for the full scope of the OS rather than just an initial impression.

Unfortunately, due to external issues taking up my time and energy, Cosmic desktop delays, and overall more complexity that I had anticipated, that plan didn't really pan out the way I had hoped. As a result, I'm going to take my learnings from that, finish doing some more research to help streamline some of the testing I'd like to do, and try again in 2026.

Since I don't want my external struggles and my learning process to color the final results of this, I'm going to be compiling the information that I think is relevant and archive the rest of what I had written for 2025. I'm also going to limit the scope of some of what I want to try, not because there are other limitations on what I can try and on my areas of expertise, and I'd rather not let those limitations present any false impressions anyone reading this may have.
