# Linux Distro Hopping 2026
In early 2025, I build a new desktop PC and decided to see what other Linux distros are like after using the same one for over a decade. To do so, I decided to hop around a few distributions and stick on them for about a month each to see how they performed for extended use. I figured a month would be enough time to really get a good feel for the full scope of the OS rather than just an initial impression.

Unfortunately, due to external issues taking up my time and energy, Cosmic desktop delays, and overall more complexity that I had anticipated, that plan didn't really pan out the way I had hoped. As a result, I'm going to take my learnings from that, finish doing some more research to help streamline some of the testing I'd like to do, and try again in 2026.

Since I don't want my external struggles and my learning process to color the final results of this, I'm going to be compiling the information that I think is relevant and archive the rest of what I had written for 2025. I'm also going to limit the scope of some of what I want to try, not because there are other limitations on what I can try and on my areas of expertise, and I'd rather not let those limitations present any false impressions anyone reading this may have.

## My Use Case
* I don't mind some customization, but I want to keep it fairly light and I'd like to keep it to using graphical tools if I can.
  * I'm all for adding a few extensions so that I can use my computer the way I like, but I'd like it to be a good experience out of the box with just a few small tweaks to suite my preferences.
  * While I am comfortable in a terminal, I prefer being able to honestly tell people that you don't need it for a good experience with Linux.
* Light Gaming (both directly on system and with a Steam Link)
  * Not really a competitive gamer, so I'm not too worried about anti-cheat issues, but I do play some games.
  * May also try some Gamecube/PS2 era emulation, but not entirely sure yet.
  * Hoping I can get VR working, but there are some potentially confounding hardware issues with my setup.
* 3D Printing with PrusaSlicer (or if it ever gets published to Flathub, OrcaSlicer)
  * I do a bit of 3D modeling as well, but since that's in Onshape (a browser based CAD tool) it shouldn't really matter what distro I'm in.
* Light Development tasks
  * Containers with Podman
  * Go and Node development
* I'd like to have some remote connectivity for my laptop and a potential thin client I'm considering setting up.

## Other Software I'll Try
* Streaming with OBS (both PC games and console games).
  * I don't really have a lot of interest in steaming myself, but I am interested in the technology and would like to try learning it, and this seems like a good opportunity.
  * I may not actually test this on a real streaming platform, but just on a Discord server.
* Running Android apps on Waydroid.
  * This is not going to be a deal-breaker for the tie breaker as I don't have a use case for it and the biggest blocker is Wayland support, which the Mint team is working on, but I do want to try it out.
* Video editing with DaVinci Resolve.
  * Similar to Waydroid, this one will not be a deal-breaker as I don't need it, but I have heard it can be finicky, so I'd like to get some first hand experience trying to set it up.

**Note:** I'd also put in VR, but don't want hardware to be a confounding factor (I have a meta quest 3, which seems to be less compatible than other options). May look into it more once Steam Frame is out.

## Recommending Linux To Others
In addition to my own use case, I'd also like something that I can recommend to anyone new to Linux. Being able to say "I use this everyday, it's really stable and it just works" is a lot more powerful than saying "yeah, my setup is really complicated, but it doesn't need to be". Being able to give people a clear demo on my own personal machine and say "no, I didn't need a terminal to get any of this working" is a big thing that could help anyone interested in switching to Linux but is anxiously thinking that you need to be technical to use it.

I'm not necessarily trying to find a "one size fits all" distribution, so much as one that I think isn't going to be especially uncomfortable for anyone open to making the switch to Linux and that doesn't require any significant technical experience to use.

?>**Note:** The biggest exception to this is going to be that I am not qualified to evaluate accessibility tools. Given [a recent article about the state of accessibility on Linux](https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/blog/i-want-to-love-linux-it-doesnt-love-me-back-post-1-built-for-control-but-not-for-people/), I am not particularly comfortable making any recommendation to anyone with accessibility needs without a larger conversation about their needs, their technical ability, and the compromises they are willing to accept. Even then, I would need to do a lot of research and would need to make clear that I don't have any first hand experience with these tools.
