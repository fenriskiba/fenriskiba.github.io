<!-- ### Zorin OS Pro
While I didn't use Zorin OS Pro, I did want to talk about it a bit.

Overall, I like the idea of a one-time payment to get some pre-configured software/themes and (more importantly) support. It helps fund the project and makes thing more sustainable, which is a real problem in a world where both companies and individuals alike are taking open source software for granted. The promise of support also makes the migration to Linux much less intimidating and more reliable.

However, I do have a couple of issues with how Zorin markets their Pro edition. I feel the way they present the additional software is somewhat disingenuous and the installation support isn't very comprehensive (at least not the way it's described in the marketing page).

#### Pre-Installed Software
Zorin Pro is described as coming with *"advanced productivity tools"* and a *"professional-grade creative suite of apps"*, but when you look into what all that means it's a lot less exciting than it's presented.

The first thing that tipped me off to the problem was that it somewhat difficult to figure out what the pre-installed applications even are. The only way you can find it on their site, is as a zip file you can download with dumps of what seems to be every system package and Flatpak installed on the system (even extremely low-level packages like libraries and `bash` are listed). I had to [go to Reddit to find a proper list of applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/zorinos/comments/1mh1l5a/comment/n6t42xg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and was extremely disappointed by what I found.

Most if not all of the pre-installed software is freely available, open source apps that can be installed with a single click in the software manager. Now, with the right presentation, I wouldn't really consider that a problem. Bringing more attention to open source tools that can do the same things as proprietary ones is great, and providing them out of the box so that users don't need to research and install alternatives themselves is a totally reasonable way to provide additional value to anyone supporting the project. However, that's not an excuse to mislead users (which I have to assume is intentional) into thinking they are getting [*"over $5,000 of professional software"*](https://zorin.com/os/pro/#:~:text=over%20%245%2C000%20of%20professional%20software) by de-emphasizing the word "alternatives" with lower contrast, greyed out text.

I really worry that this presentation will lead to people feeling like they've been burned and lied to and won't trust anyone making a more honest effort to help them switch to Linux. It also risks solidifying the impression people have of Linux as being buggy and less intuitive when some of those alternatives turn out to be wildly different from what they were expecting.
* People trained on Photoshop generally seem to struggle with how different GIMPs design is.
* FreeCAD and LibreCAD have been reviewed by makers who *want* to support open source, and they still find it lacking.
* Kdenlive is great for occasional use or amateur film editing, but doesn't have a lot of the features needed to replace a professional tool like Adobe Premier.

It's especially concerning that they are risking people getting the impression that Linux isn't capable when some of these tools have other alternatives, that work on Linux, without the same compromises in quality. They just can't be bundled with Zorin Pro due to it being proprietary (ex. DaVinci Resolve or OnShape).

#### Zorin Pro Support
The other concern I have is that they only promise support for the initial installation of Zorin OS.

!>**Important:** Since I didn't use Zorin Pro, I obviously have never actually tried using the Zorin Pro support services, so I am very strictly basing this on what I found on the marketing site. If I find any information that contradicts what I'm saying here, I will update this section to focus on making the truth more clear on that site.

This has some similar concerns as with the software, where someone might think they are going to get more support past the initial setup. It isn't too clearly defined where [*"setting up Zorin OS"*](https://zorin.com/os/pro/#:~:text=or%20queries%20while-,setting%20up%20Zorin%20OS,-%3F%20Each%20copy%20of) and the support that comes with it ends. Personally, I would assume that once everything is installed and your are logged into your computer, but my parents would probably think it would continue into getting any software they need that isn't pre-packaged installed and configured.

I'd also argue that the support should go well beyond just the installation and be the most valuable part of the Pro edition. Especially for a distro that's explicitly marketed at people migrating from other operating systems, because that is the audience that is going to need the most help throughout their time using the system. Marketing yourself as "the best distro for new users" and charging for support, only to tell them that they only payed for support for their first couple hours of use? That just seems like setting your users up for failure and making people feel like they won't be able to be successful on Linux.

I recognize that supporting more than the initial installation would probably be difficult to scale up, so it may not be a realistic option. However, I think there are ways to help those users and make paying for the Pro edition much more worth it. A support forum with a bounty program for community members resolving Pro user problems. Additional "How To" guides that only Pro users get access and that Pro users can request new entries into. Something to help them with the full scope of their migration to Linux rather than just the start of it. -->
