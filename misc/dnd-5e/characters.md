# D&D 5e Characters
Characters I've made and played in different D&D campaigns. A lot of these campaigns didn't really take off for various reasons, but I still like the characters I've created and want to keep them documented here.

In the future, I'd like to build out a character sheet template that I can use with this site and move them here, but until then they are all links to Dicecloud.

| Character       | Race/Species               | Class   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Miri Ulmokina] | Kor                        | Ranger  | A simple ranger build for a Zendikar based campaign we never really got to play. I was still figuring out the 5e mechanics, so not a great build overall. I think I was going for more of a swashbuckler-style idea, but didn't really know how to pull that off right.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Lenna Vendan]  | Elf (Eladrin)              | Fighter | I don't remember much about the campaign for this since we only had a couple sessions. If I remember correctly, we had a randomized character creation session where the species was rolled for and the stats were rolled in order so we didn't have any control over which rolls went to which stat.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Grrr Wan]      | Dragonborn (Green)         | Cleric  | A Dragonborn cleric raised by wolves. I had a lot of fun writing this character backstory because we rolled for personality traits, ideals, etc. and I rolled *"I was, in fact, raised by wolves."* The rest of the character just kind of got built based on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Bharash (v1)]  | Human                      | Cleric  | A knowledge cleric raised by Dragonborn wizards. Not to much to say beyond that since the campaign didn't really set off, but I did like the backstory so I kept it around to repurpose for a later campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Meh]           | Gnome (Homebrewed variant) | Rogue   | For this campaign we rolled for basically everything (species, character traits, gender, etc.), and my roll for species came up with *"the DM will homebrew your request,"* so I asked them for a Shade. They built a version of that based on the setting for the campaign where magic had been violently ripped from the world. It was a really fun character to play, but unfortunately we TPK'd during our second or third session.                                            |
| [Aldys]         | Elf (Eladrin)              | Rogue   | This was built for an after work playgroup with some co-workers, and I really liked the idea of Eladrin, both from a flavor perspective and the Fey Step ability. I really enjoyed writing the backstory for Aldys and we had a lot of fun since we had two rogues in the party who would sneak off for shenanigans in the middle of the nights.                                                                                                                                   |
| [Growler]       | Kenku                      | Rogue   | A Kenku Arcane Trickster I built for Curse of Strahd with the after work playgroup. I really liked the idea of a Kenku needing to mimic the verbal components of spells, so I kind of ran with the build from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Bharash (v2)]  | Gnome (Forest)             | Wizard  | A healer wizard using the Theurgy Arcane Tradition from Unearthed Arcana. I really like this idea of a pure utility wizard and we had some fun using Grave Domain for the flavor. I was hoping to run with the idea of a purely academic perspective on healing and not understanding why the good aligned characters were freaked out by necromancy spells being used to heal them. Unfortunately, we only had time for a couple sessions before the GM got too busy to continue. |
