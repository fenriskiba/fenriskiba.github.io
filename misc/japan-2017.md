# UA Study Abroad in Japan 2017
In 2017, I was able to participate in a two week study abroad program in Japan with the University of Akron. As part of the program, we were expected to keep a blog with certain information on Tumblr. Because I don't really use that Tumblr account anymore, I decided to copy everything over here before deleting the account so that I could maintain it for my records.

I will put the disclaimer that a lot of this is just answering questions for homework or rushed out since I was more focused on enjoying my time in Japan. As such, this isn't exactly my best writing.

## March 5, 2017: Homework 1
"This writing system causes the Japanese to think in a different way from us." (p.13)  
I hadn't really considered this very well before. In my struggles with kanji in the past, I've always considered it a convoluted system (and still do), but it seems much more reasonable given more context. Kanji has had a strong influence on Japan, and, as such, the way the Japanese people deal with Kanji is much more fluid that it would be to someone trying to learn it new.

"This whole philosophy [Bushido] has reached the West through the martial arts." (p.15)  
I hadn't really considered Bushido to have spread into as much of modern culture as it has. I often consider it similar to Western Chivalry, but it seems to be much more subtle, which has allowed it to spread into more aspects of Japanese society than chivalry did in the west.

"The most beautiful Shinto shrines are usually in the middle of woods, surrounded by trees, forming part of nature." (p.22)  
As someone who grew up surrounded by the woods, I find this rather interesting. Being in a wooded area seems like it would allow for a much calmer and more relaxed experience than I have experienced with most American examples of spiritualism.

"As with Shodo, although it [chado/the tea ceremony] may seem simple at first glance, you need several years to learn all the steps in the tea ceremony." (p.28)  
I'm very curious as to why the tea ceremony is so complex. I'd like to understand what about the many steps of the tea ceremony make them important. Do they improve some aspect of the tea, or are they just tradition for traditions sake?

"A koan is a brief story in the form of a riddle or fable that a Zen teacher uses to teach lessons to students." (p.30)  
It is interesting reading some of the koans privided in the book. Some of them seem fairly simple to me, but others are rather hard to understand. I found it interesting that the author made the last koan on page 31 seem extremely difficult, but it was one that seemed the most straight-forward to me.

"Besides its [ikebana] decorative function, its also used as a method of meditation." (p.31)  
I like this idea of meditation not only being concentration, but potentially being simple relaxing tasks. I often find that focusing on something simple can lead me to consider much more complex ideas, so I can very easily understand how this would work.

**Chapter 3**  
*"Alcohol is the most common means to go from tatemae to honne." (p.36)*  
I'm curious how this works with people who can be aggressive when drinking, or with someone like me who doesn't like drinking.

*"In Japan, gifts are very important within the system, and there is a series of unwritten rules that, when broken, can cause social 'unease.'" (p.38)*  
This seems very stressful, which is an interesting comparison to America where gift-giving tends to be more exciting. Picking a gift can be aggrevating, but getting one is always a happy thing.

*"The Japanese learn through repetition at school and in college. They are hardly given any option to think for themselves. They tend to be satisfied with established rules, following the set path without making life difficult for themselves, instead of seeking to be original or creating new ideas." (p.43)*  
While I certainly respect wanting to follow the path of least resistance, I always try to understand the path and openly question when something seems flawed. I could never imagine being part of a culture that seems against considering if a solution is ideal just because it
